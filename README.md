# MauiDoom

Maui Doom is a fork of [Managed Doom](https://github.com/sinshu/managed-doom) which is a Doom source port written in C#. The code is adapted to work with .NET MAUI for Android and iOS. The project allows you to play the classic Doom on mobile devices with cross-platform support provided by MAUI using a unified codebase.

## Getting Started

You will need:
- .NET MAUI installed (part of .NET 6+ SDK)
- Visual Studio 2022 or later, with .NET workloads installed (android & ios)
